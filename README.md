# CFB Index #

College football statistics API and web app.

## My Process ##
1. First, I gathered information from various sources including CollegeFootballData.com.
2. Next, I used MySQL to create a database to store college football recruiting data on players and teams.
3. Finally, I created a Flask API to connect the database to endpoints.
